# Tic-Tak-Toe

The application runs on Android.
For this project, I used Java language and Android Studio to build it.
This repository contains my code, so feel free to download it and try it out. 
In this project, there is a lot of room for improvement.
I would appreciate any suggestions you may have.




HOW TO PLAY :-
The goal of tic-tac-toe is to be the first player to get three in a row on a 3-by-3 grid or four in a row in a 4-by-4 grid. 
To start, one player draws a board, creating a grid of squares, usually 3-by-3 or 4-by-4.
In a 3-by-3 grid game, the player who is playing "X" always goes first. Players alternate placing Xs and Os on the board until either player has three in a row, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally or until all squares on the grid are filled. If a player is able to draw three Xs or three Os in a row, then that player wins. If all squares are filled and neither player has made a complete row of Xs or Os, then the game is a draw.
